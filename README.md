# InstantAnswer
This API does not include all of our links, however. That is, it is not a full search results API or a way to get DuckDuckGo 
results into your applications beyond our instant answers. Because of the way we generate our search results, we unfortunately do not have the rights to fully syndicate our results, free or paid. For the same reason, we cannot allow framing our results without our branding. Please see our partnerships page for more info on guidelines and getting in touch with us.

Our long-term goal is for all of our instant answers to be available through this open API. Many of these instant answers are open source via our DuckDuckHack platform. Using that platform, you can add your own APIs and data sources as well.Our instant answers come from a variety of sources, including Wikipedia, Wikia, CrunchBase, GitHub, WikiHow, The Free Dictionary â€“ over 100 in total.
